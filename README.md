ActiveRecord (lite!)
====================

This project is a clone of some of the core features of ActiveRecord.  For science.

## Features cloned:
* Rails query methods (where, find, all)
* Methods for database persistence (create, update, save)
* Associations (belongs\_to, has\_many, has\_one :through)
